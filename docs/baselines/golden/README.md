# Golden Baselines — Quick References

This directory provides **quick reference links** for golden baselines, used in regressions, IDE rules, and rapid testing validations.

## Available Quick References

- **Deepgram Agent**: see `deepgram.md`
- **OpenAI Realtime**: see `openai.md`
- **Google Live**: see `google-live.md`
- **v6.1.1 Validation Matrix**: see `v6.1.1-validation-matrix.md`
- **ElevenLabs Agent**: see [`docs/contributing/references/Provider-ElevenLabs-Implementation.md`](../../contributing/references/Provider-ElevenLabs-Implementation.md)

## Purpose

These lightweight files provide:
- Links to detailed case studies in `docs/case-studies/`
- Links to canonical logs in `logs/remote/`
- Quick validation checks to match baseline behavior
- References for IDE rules and testing frameworks

## For Detailed Documentation

For **complete production documentation** including configurations, metrics, lessons learned, and troubleshooting:

👉 **See: [`docs/case-studies/`](../../case-studies/)**

Use these quick references when guiding testing, RCA, or comparing against working behavior. Prefer these references over ad-hoc dated paths in prompts and rules.
